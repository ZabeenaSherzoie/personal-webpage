    <h1>Zabeena Sherzoie</h1>
    <p>
        As a curious person I have always tried to find the answers for my questions by exploring and experiencing 
        everything myself. I was born and raised in Kabul city. While I was in grade 8 and 9, I found out my passion 
        about technology and most specificly computer programming. From that time I started learning basic hacking and programming techniques. 
        In 2019 when I was graduated, I started studying for Kankoor and in 2020 I was accepted to Kabul University, Computer Science faculty. 
        Unfortunately, due to the political situations, I wasn't able to continue after second year. My hobbies are reading and learning new languages. Still, I continued learning and working on my 
        skills. Now I am here to learn and improve my Web Development skills.
